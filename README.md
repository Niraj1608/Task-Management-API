# Task Management API

This is a **Task Management API** built with Spring Boot. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. It utilizes JWT for security and Swagger for interactive API documentation. The project is designed using the DTO pattern, tested with JUnit and Mockito, and leverages Spring Data JPA with Hibernate for data persistence.

## Features

1. **CRUD Operations for Tasks**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks.
2. **User Authentication with JWT**: Secure the API using JWT for user authentication.
3. **DTO (Data Transfer Objects)**: Separate business logic from the entity model.
4. **Unit and Integration Testing**: Tested with JUnit and Mockito for reliable service layers.
5. **Swagger API Documentation**: Interactive API exploration.
6. **Spring Security with JWT**: Token-based security for all API endpoints.
7. **Lombok Integration**: Reduces boilerplate code in the entity and service layers.
8. **JPA and Hibernate**: ORM for database interaction using Spring Data JPA.
9. **Mockito**: For testing service layers and mocking dependencies.
