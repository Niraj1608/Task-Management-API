# Backend | Task Management API

- **Developed and maintained a Spring Boot backend to provide a comprehensive API for task management.**
  - **Task Management APIs**:
    - Implemented CRUD operations for managing tasks, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
    - Designed user authentication functionality using JWT for secure access to APIs.
    - Developed a system for role-based access control for users and administrators.
  - **User Authentication**:
    - Integrated JWT for secure token-based authentication, ensuring secure access to protected endpoints.
    - Implemented user registration and login functionalities.

- **Enhanced the backend with additional features**:
  - **DTO (Data Transfer Objects)**: Utilized DTOs to separate the business logic from the entity model for better maintainability.
  - **Swagger API Documentation**: Employed Swagger (springdoc-openapi) for interactive API documentation to facilitate exploration of endpoints.
  - **Unit and Integration Testing**: Conducted thorough testing using JUnit and Mockito to ensure the reliability and functionality of the APIs.

- **Ensured code quality and reliability**:
  - Developed unit tests for each service layer using JUnit to guarantee robust functionality and reliability of the APIs.
  - Implemented comprehensive exception handling to manage errors gracefully and improve system resilience.

- **Architected the API request flow**:
  - Structured the request flow from data validation to REST controllers, service layers, DAO repositories (entities), and database interactions.

**Technologies Used**: Spring Boot, Java 17 or higher, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, JWT, Swagger, Lombok, JUnit, Mockito, MySQL, MapStruct
