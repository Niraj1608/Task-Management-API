# Task_Management_API
This is a Task Management API built with Spring Boot. It provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. It uses JWT for security, and Swagger for interactive API documentation. The project is designed using the DTO pattern, tested using JUnit and Mockito, and utilizes Spring Data JPA with Hibernate for data persistence.
Features
1-CRUD operations for Tasks: Create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks.
2-User Authentication with JWT: Secure the API using JWT for user authentication.
3-DTO (Data Transfer Objects): Separate business logic from the entity model.
4-Unit and Integration Testing: Tested with JUnit and Mockito.
5-Swagger API Documentation: Explore API endpoints interactively.
6-Spring Security with JWT: Secure the endpoints with token-based authentication.
7-Lombok Integration: Use Lombok to reduce boilerplate code in the entity and service layers.
8-JPA and Hibernate: ORM for database interactions with Spring Data JPA.
9-Mockito: For testing service layers and mocking dependencies.
